Automated Deadlock Detection Tool: 

The Automated Deadlock Detection Tool is a Python-based application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using PyQt6 and NetworkX. It helps detect deadlocks in process-resource allocation scenarios by using graph cycle detection techniques.  

This tool allows users to dynamically add processes, allocate resources, and check for deadlocks in real time. The system models process-resource relationships and uses graph theory to analyze and detect circular dependencies that indicate a deadlock.  

Key Features  

Process and Resource Management: Users can add processes and resources dynamically.  
Resource Allocation and Requests: Simulate how resources are requested and allocated to processes.  
Deadlock Detection: Uses graph cycle detection to identify deadlocks in real time.  
User-Friendly Interface: Built with PyQt6 for an interactive experience.  
Error Handling and Logging: Provides detailed logs and alerts for detected deadlocks.  
Graph Visualization: Displays the process-resource allocation graph.  

System Modules  

Process and Resource Management  

The system allows users to create processes and resources dynamically.  
Add Process: Creates a new process in the system.  
Add Resource: Defines a new resource that processes can request.  

Resource Allocation and Requests  

Request Resource: A process requests a resource.  
Allocate Resource: A resource is assigned to a process.  
Release Resource: A process releases a resource when it's done using it.  

Deadlock Detection Mechanism  

The system detects deadlocks using graph cycle detection.  
It builds a wait-for graph where nodes represent processes and resources and edges represent dependencies.  
If a cycle is detected, a deadlock warning is issued.  

Graph Visualization  

The system provides a visual representation of the current process-resource allocation graph.  
Helps users understand the flow of resources and dependencies.  

Installation  

Install Python from the official Python website and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is selected during installation.  
Install required libraries using pip: pyqt6, networkx, and matplotlib.  

Usage  

Run the application using the Python script.  

Steps:  

Enter a process name and add it.  
Enter a resource name and add it.  
Request a resource by selecting a process and resource.  
Allocate a resource by selecting a process and resource.  
Click "Check Deadlock" to analyze if a deadlock has occurred.  

Example Scenario  

No Deadlock Case:  

Processes and resources are added.  
Resources are allocated without circular dependencies.  
The system confirms that no deadlock is detected.  

Deadlock Detected Case:  

A process requests a resource held by another process.  
A circular dependency forms where multiple processes wait for resources held by each other.  
The system detects the cycle and issues a deadlock warning.  

Graph Representation  

The system uses matplotlib to generate a process-resource allocation graph.  
Nodes represent processes and resources, and edges show resource dependencies.  
A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock.  

Security and Fault Handling  

Invalid Input Handling: Prevents invalid process or resource requests.  
Duplicate Requests: Ensures a process does not request the same resource twice.  
Cycle Detection Efficiency: Uses NetworkXâ€™s algorithms for efficient deadlock detection.  

Technologies Used  

Python 3.x  
PyQt6 for GUI  
NetworkX for graph-based deadlock detection  
Matplotlib for graph visualization  

Future Enhancements  

Advanced Visualization: Add an interactive graph visualization.  
Automated Resource Release: Implement timeout-based resource release.  
Integration with System Monitoring: Extend to detect deadlocks in OS-level process management.
